      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Dear B ‚õ∞Ô∏è ü•Æ -
        </p>
        <p>
          Creamed colored coat with belt undone, mid-height dark boots, a single blond braid, green
          purse.  My first impression, this girl sure has a lot of things hanging off of her üòÇ.  Your
          look was pretty flashy compared to what I was used to in California.  I remember you said
          you wore mis-matched shoes by accident at first, that probably would have worked with the
          outfit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pink plaid pants, cork bottomed high healed sandals, white strapless top, white square earrings with a portrait of a lady.  Another loud outfit, but I‚Äôm starting to dig it, I can appreciate the effort,
          and the creativity.  I guess she‚Äôs not the weeb I thought she was from our video chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          What‚Äôs this all about?  It‚Äôs simple really, somewhere in between that first k-town meeting
          and the ‚Äúbye Felicia‚Äù on canal street 2 weeks later, you made me feel something I‚Äôve never
          felt before and haven‚Äôt felt since üôè.  I wasn‚Äôt BSing when I said ‚ÄúI feel like I have something
          to lose,‚Äù or when ‚ÄúB*** D***‚Äù accidentally slipped out, those were both firsts for me, that
          to this day I‚Äôve never said to nor felt about anyone else.  I know you already know all of
          this though so what now?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I don‚Äôt want to live with any regrets, and I thought maybe just maybe in the spirit
          of the holiday season and if you‚Äôre feeling generous, maybe you‚Äôll give this a little read.  And maybe I‚Äôll
          get the opportunity to share all the thoughts I wished I had the opportunity to tell you in
          person.  Maybe you‚Äôll give me the gift of living with no regrets and finally being able to
          share my heart with you a little.  
          Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs a gift üéÅ, no strings attached,
          but if you do decide to forgive all the rude things I‚Äôve said and want to have a conversation
          again, I won‚Äôt say no ü•π.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also some people seem to think I need to just bare my
          heart once and for all and get it all out to get that closure.  And I agree, so selfishly
          this is for me as much as it is for you, but if it puts a smile on your face, I'll be glad üôÇ.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Apology</button>  
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Okay, let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room.  Yes, I‚Äôve said some pretty offensive things to
          you, and all I can say is I‚Äôm sorry.  I‚Äôve talked it out with a lot of people about our situation
          this summer and everyone maintains that you don‚Äôt owe me anything, and that he who shall not be
          named was the one who did me dirty.  A heads up from this person could have been at least been
          the baseline decent thing to do, I‚Äôm not surprised though.  I'd probably lie, steal, cheat, etc. for a
          shot with you too üòÇ.  And in the moment, finding out from
          you, ya the first thing I could think of was ‚Äúbetrayal!‚Äù, I‚Äôm sorry I took it out on you.  Seeing
          as how mature you are, I know that you‚Äôve seen your fair share of hurt so even if you don‚Äôt forgive
          me, maybe you can understand a little of what I was going through. It‚Äôs no excuse, but it‚Äôs the best
          I can offer you, and I‚Äôm sorry üòî.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was especially hurt when you admitted
          to having feelings for this person the whole time we were being intimate.  Regardles of our circumstances
          or what we agreed on, can you imagine someone telling you after enjoying your body that they were thinking
          of someone else the whole time?  I can only hope that I misunderstood you, but I guess that really put me
          over the edge.  I know this isn't true, but it made me feel like all I was to you was a hookup and a distraction from your previous hurt.  I guess I just want you to understand my heart a little.  We <em>are</em> the same type of animal
          after all, right?  Anyways, I'm sorry for all of that üòî.

      <button class="accordion">About you - Why I think you're amazing... üíïüíï</button>  
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Okay, on to the fun stuff.  Here is my love confession.  All the things I loved about you and why
          you‚Äôre amazing and awesome.  All the things that I wanted you to know about yourself ü•∞ that I can
          finally get off my chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, first things first, two years later and I just can‚Äôt move on‚Ä¶ even after over two years of
          direct rejection from the princess of mooncakes herself, and countless eye rolls and exasperated
          sighs from friends listening to me gush about you for the 100th time.  Is this normal?  Why am
          I like this?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              I don‚Äôt really understand it myself, but after a lot of reflection I can attempt to attribute it
              down to 2 main things.  The first is that I felt that we really got along well.  Hanging out with
              you felt really comfortable and natural.  I loved that you were down for anything - shopping, eating,
              walking around the city.  Sitting on the west side and having such a good time you forgot your
              purse!  Even though it was the middle of the pandemic and we didn‚Äôt do anything too flashy, it just
              seemed like we always had a good time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I asked your friends about you a bit at Haiyin‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs party.  June‚Äôs tall Spanish boyfriend
              said that you were the best in the group at some shooting game you guys played (PUBG?).  I loved that
              you were down to explore stuff like gaming and snowboarding.  I remember you ride regular, but goofy
              when you get on the lift.  I ride goofy too so it would have worked out well and would have been super
              fun to go snowboarding with you.  Haiyin also said you spent alot of time in the kitchen when you were
              living together and I was also super curious to taste your cooking.
              
              Anyways, In life, I feel that I‚Äôm a curious person and I love exploring new
              things.  I guess what I saw in you was someone who was open-minded to new experiences and who would
              be an amazing companion to explore all the rest of what life has to offer and to have a great time
              doing it together.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="highlight">
            <div class="highlight-background">
              <p>
                The 2nd main thing was that I felt that even in those two short weeks, you loved me better than anyone
                ever has.  If there was a single moment that epitomized it, I would say that it was on the Wednesday
                evening after we had worked from home together and we were lounging in my room.  We had a few light
                puffs of that joint you helped me roll.  We were on the bed and I was cuddling on top of you.  I
                remember looking directly in your eyes and what I saw,.. I mean my heart just melted.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I smoke, sometimes when it hits just right, I get hyper sensitive to what other people are feeling,
                it‚Äôs almost like I can read minds.  When I looked into your eyes, I read your mind too.  All I said was
                something like ‚ÄúYou <em>DO</em> like me.‚Äù  But what I saw when I read your mind that night, no ones ever looked
                at me the way you did or felt about me the same way.  The feeling I felt from you, it looked like the
                feeling of someone who‚Äôs come to the end of a long search and finally found someone who might be her
                soulmate.  A soulmate who was too stupid to realize it yet.  The main emotion I felt from you was nerves.  Like
                he doesn‚Äôt realize it yet, and he‚Äôs not quite there yet, I don‚Äôt want to say or do anything that‚Äôll confuse him,
                until he gets there - no matter what, I want to keep him.
              </p>
              <p>
                This all sounds like alot and maybe a little conceited, maybe it's just wishful thinking and projection üòÇ.
                I don‚Äôt mean it to be, it‚Äôs just how I interpreted
                your energy.  Maybe my read was completely off, but it‚Äôs what kept me going these 2 years, knowing that deep
                down at one point you could feel that strongly about me.  It just made me feel like, if I could just convince
                her to give it a shot I would die to see that look again.  It‚Äôs the kind of look that even if I was starving
                and cold, down on my luck, a single look would be enough to make my heart feel full, satiated, and warm, and
                life‚Äôs problems would just feel so small in comparison.  The kind of look that I would trade a life of wealth
                and material comfort in a heart beat for.  You have a real gift, maybe I‚Äôm being ridiculous, but that‚Äôs why
                in my heart, since I met you, there‚Äôs only ever really been space for you.

          hang out for a bit, but once they start getting close, she has to push him away, she‚Äôs just not ready, it‚Äôs
          like she has a three month rule or something üôÉ (also her boyfriend just died).  Anyways, like 2 years later,
          they‚Äôre sitting at a restaurant with this new guy she‚Äôs about to start dating and he tells the new guys 10
          rules to help him win her heart.  Here‚Äôs a link to the
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZQ6xoMEa4E" target="_blank">super cute scene</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I‚Äôll end this section here, but if you‚Äôre interested in more things that I loved about you, give the window
          below a scroll.  I‚Äôve included my version of the 10 things, except I couldn‚Äôt stop at 10 üòù
        </p>

                You are really thoughtful and really pay attention to the details.  I was touched by
                that eye-mask you bought me after you noticed I cover my face with a t-shirt when I sleep.
                I still have that eye mask.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                In the same vein of thoughtfulness, you took me winter clothes shopping multiple times
                when you knew I needed winter clothes.  I won't forget that.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                You somehow remembered that I love molten chocolate cake and introduced me to spot dessert
                for my first time.  I still think about that when I go to that spot, but it never feels
                quite the same as that first time.  I'm also amazed how you remembered that.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I loved your artsy vibe.  I still have that miniature pumpkin that you decorated with your
                eye-liner from our first date.  I thought about burying it a bunch of times as a symbol of
                closure, but could never get myself to do it.  It's sort of dried out now üòÖ.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I always regretted never having had a chance to flip through your sketch book.  I've always
                been curious to see what sorts of things interest you and that you like to sketch.  As John
                Legend would say, "what's going on in that beautiful mind?"  I'd like to know.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                (Part 1)
                Speaking of gifts, I also held on to that purple quartz rock you gave me.  I also wanted to gift
                you this beautiful pink rose quartz stone I picked out for you.  Among other things it symbolizes unconditionally love.
                Love of all kinds, including friends, family, siblings, and also romantic.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                (Part 2)
                It sort of sums up how
                I'll always feel about you.  Even if we never speak again, I'll always be thankful for the time
                we shared and love you for that.  I was planning to give you
                the stone when
                we were supposed to have lunch last winter because it also symbolizes new beginnings.  I just wanted
                you to know.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I really love your energy.  I love how confident you are in who you are and how you are so yourself.
                I love how you aren't trying to be anyone else but you and you live by your own standards.  I've always
                been envious of people like that and I've always admired you for that.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I loved the cute little couply gestures you would do like going into revolving doors together.  I'm actually
                into that stuff and I won't let us walk past a pole on opposite sides.  I guess one must have slipped
                through though seeing as how we're no longer talking üòî.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                You introduced me to so many firsts.  I loved how confident and experienced you were with
                winter jackets, truffle pizza, psychedelics, bedroom / pegging üòÇ.  I guess the first time is
                hard to forget.  I always wished I had the chance to return the favor one day.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                You are legit the best communicator I have ever met and I firmly believe the quality of your communication
                is the quality of your life.  It's probably one of the main reasons I fell so hard and so fast for you.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I love how you always do a compliment sandwich when delivering constructive feedback.  I remember you gave your
                sister some advice one time about how she should have handled a situation and you ended it with "and here's
                a picture of me as a dog."  That was so sweet, I loved it.  Thank you for always being that way with me too.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                Thank you for being patient with me.  It doesn't seem like there are any guys who can match you in relationship
                experience.  I'm thankful that you took me along for the ride, and let me try my best to learn and keep up with you.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                Thank you for that time we couldn't find Haiyin's boyfriend's apartment and you were letting me navigate and despite
                my going the wrong way and your knowing how to get there the whole time you still let me drive.  I thought that
                was really tactful and I always appreciated how you handle things like that.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I like your voice.  Your voice is thick and sexy and feminine and confident all
                wrapped up in a perfect little package.  I like the way you smell too.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I wanted you to know that I keep a cabinet full of bottled water in case you ever come back into my life.
                Sparkling, still, and flavored water.  We both know tap water is bad for you.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                (Part 1) I like exactly how big you are.  I love that when we cuddled back then your body fit perfectly
                between my arms.  Back then when I showed you pictures of my ex's, it's because I wanted you to
                feel confident in knowing that you were my type physically.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                (Part 2) I could be wrong, but I thought
                I sensed a little insecurity, maybe not about your looks but about something.  I just wanted to
                boost you up.  I've always been into
                small cute girls.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I loved the way you made me feel wanted and needed.  Like when you texted me "come back to me"
                that one time I went downstairs to buy tampons.  It's cute and I want that back in my life.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I loved how you were always working hard to add value to my life.  Like cleaning up the dinner right after
                we ate because you were "used to it" because of your dog.  Or telling me about how much bacteria is
                on the wooden benches in the subway.  I loved your energy and desire to contribute.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                (Part 1) I loved how eager you were to come over that one time I made you a cocktail and you stumbled over
                the basketball and I was holding a knife and there could have been a disaster.  My reflexes were definitely 
                too fast for that to happen, but if it did... 
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                (Part 2) If it did, I want you to know I would have loved you just the same and stayed with you and
                made sure you felt beautiful everyday and cursed out anyone who even thought about looking at you funny.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I love that you like sitting on the same side of the table as your person at restaurants.  I thought I was the only
                one who liked it.  I'm planning to make my partner sit with me and am prepared for a life time
                of weird looks from everyone.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I love how experienced you are with people and relationships.  I know I'll never match you, but just being
                in your presence, things just flow smoothly and effortlessly.  It's a quality I've always admired
                but just haven't been able to articulate until now.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I love the way you keep up your appearance.  You make the clothes you wear look good and I love
                how your wardrobe has such a wide range.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I love that I can tell you anything and you really hear me.  Maybe it's cause you've done it all already.
                Maybe you're just a great listener.  I don't know what it is, but it makes me want to tell you everything
                that's happened in my day and now, since it's been awhile, life.
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                I think your eyes are really beautiful and I loved your cat eye.  That netflix show Queen's Gambit
                came out shortly after we hung out.  And the main actress has big pretty eyes like you.  And I couldn't
                stop watching just so I could be reminded of our time together. üòÖ
              </div>
              <div class="slide">
                Everytime we text I get nervous.  Everytime I've reached out to you over the past 2 years, I've basically
                been super nervous and essentially lose an entire day of productivity of doing anything.  I can't work or do anything
                and just have butterflies all day.  Embarassing I know üòÖ.  You meant a lot to me.

      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Oh you‚Äôre still reading?  Well if somewhere in the back of your mind you were toying with
          the ghost of possibility of a remote chance of hypothetically talking to me again.  What
          would I bring to the table?  I understand we didn‚Äôt get a chance to <em>really really</em> get to know
          each other back then.  I remember you asked me if I was good at smash, or basketball, or had a
          lot of friends, like you expected me to impress you.  I wanted you to find out slowly over time,
          but now seeing as I may never get the chance, I guess I‚Äôll have to put together this weird list.
          Lol. So here are some of the things I‚Äôm good at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also a quick note, before we dive in.  When you freaked out that time when I asked you to just
          buy me the Canada Goose jacket.  And when I tried to buy your favorite van leuwen flavors for our
          psychedelic weekend (Black Sesame, Green Tea, Pistachio, and I forgot the fourth üòÖ).  It's like every kind
          gesture I would do would just push you away.  How could you expect someone to put in effort or
          try to impress you in that type of situation?  Just saying, you had me thoroughly confused.  Anyways, on to the weird list.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I‚Äôm responsible - I never ended up cracking that iPhone 8 I had back then, and I still don‚Äôt use
            a case on my phone these days.
          </li>
          <li>
            I‚Äôm healthy - No known health conditions, no history of anything in the family, no broken bones,
            only 1 cavity, no contacts, can digest milk, work out religiously to stay slim and I‚Äôm mindful of eating my fruits
            and veggies.  And my parents instilled pretty healthy eating habits which still persist to this day.  Although
            some of the healthy food is sort of gross haha.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speaking of parents, I have a good relationship with mine, we talk to each other and help each other out.  And
            my mom is super sweet, really giving, and not the type of person where‚Äôd there be any weird tension between her
            and a daughter in law.  My mom‚Äôs mom actually lives with a daughter in law and they get along really well and she‚Äôs
            welcomed and part of the family and that‚Äôs just how things are done in the family.  Also speaking of parents,
            did I ever tell you my mom's a monkey and my dad's a dragon.  And I'm a dragon too o_O
          </li>
          <li>
            I‚Äôm honest - If you think I‚Äôm a big baby, then you know that babies are way too innocent to lie.  Ya I grew up in
            a pretty soft environment, but I‚Äôm actually proud of being soft.  It means you‚Äôre still willing to trust and to
            love without holding back and that the world hasn‚Äôt made you jaded.  I bring this up because you called me out
            once for being soft.  If I become not soft one day then that‚Äôll mean the world won, and that I let the ugly parts
            of it change me, I‚Äôll learn from those parts, but I‚Äôll never want to let them make me anything but soft.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Also babies would never purposely splash soy sauce on someone.  I still don‚Äôt really understand what you were
              getting at with that, but it kind of makes you wonder what kind of world would someone comes from where that‚Äôs
              even a thing.  I can‚Äôt honestly say I‚Äôve ever met anyone besides Glady‚Äôs who ‚Äúfell down some stairs‚Äù either.  I
              don‚Äôt really get it and maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding things, but if not, I always hoped to show you a different
              type of world.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, in the world I come from, women don‚Äôt get used for their bodies.  If two people decide to get intimate
              early on, it‚Äôs because they like each other and that‚Äôs it.  It‚Äôs really that simple.  Women are super empowered
              these days and can decide for themselves what they want - especially in the bay where it's like 10 guys to a girl.
              So I just wanted you to know that I didn‚Äôt mean any disrespect by it.  And if you felt like I was pushy I'd say more
              than anything I wanted to build intimacy (emotional) quickly since it seemed like you were talking to so many other
              guys and also not too sure of what you wanted.  Anyways, I just wanted you to know how I felt.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            I listen - Maybe not right away, but I've gotten the feedback from partners that if they tell me where
            I messed up and why, I'll think about it, sleep on it, and eventually understand and act on it.  And that's 
            what I want and who I am, to continue to grow and get better everyday so I can be the best partner and just generally
            best person that I can be.  And let's be real, I don't care how experienced someone is in relationships,
            they are never going to get EVERYTHING right, so better to be open to conflict resolution and growth than to be
            experienced and closed-minded.  Wouldn't you agree?            
            And if you tell me you "don't feel that way about me" for the millionth time, I guess I'll have no choice
            but to accept it this last time üò≠.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Speaking of conflict resolution, I'd like to think that's one of my strong points.  With the right partners,
              we rarely get into actual full blown fights, but disagreements are inevitable.  I'd like to think that I'm really good
              at talking things out without getting emotional.  One analogy that I like to live by is if two
              people are fighting over a cake, it's better to ask questions and see, okay maybe one person likes frosting more, or the
              crust more, or the toppings more.  So rather than both people fighting for a bigger slice of cake, maybe the cake can be split up
              between frosting, and toppings, and crust, etc.  Sometimes its harder to have those clarifying questions over text though.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I <em>hate hate hate,</em> fighting over text because
              it's so easy for things to be miscommunicated or to not fully understand the other person's perspective.
              And I hate that that's how things ended between us, and I wish I could go back, and changes things.  Understand more, before
              letting things get too emotional.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              People like me and I have a good range.  I‚Äôm good at building relationships with a wide variety / diversity of people
              and I‚Äôve built a moderately good network in NY as well.  I don‚Äôt care about labels and paper qualifications as much
              and I really enjoy down to Earth party people.  I mention ‚Äúparty people‚Äù because I really value soft skills.  The qualify
              of your communication is the quality of your life!  I can also hold my own with the bougie HBS, HLS, types.  As well as
              the weeby engineering type I see at Google all the time.  The main filter criteria I have is strong character, it‚Äôs harder
              to trust people who don‚Äôt live by a code.  I also know multiple 6 ft+, asian millionaires so there are reasons to know
              me üòÇ.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course I don‚Äôt like sharing my network with people who have not or do not intend to add value
              to my life of equal value.  Or who aren't even close enough with me to jump on the phone. I think you know what
              I'm getting at, and I don't mean to be mean, but someone I really respected once told me "You can't just take whatever you want" and
              it's something I took to heart.  I guess I just wanted to share in the spirit of my desiring closure and getting it
              all out.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a huge collection of great music.  I can talk your ear off about it, and my knowledge is historical and broad.  There
              are some artists that only ever got big in SoCal, there are some artists that are only big within certain demographics.  You
              will be kept in the know and have the opportunity to explore a lot!  I remember also mentioning back then that people fall
              in love at Raves.  That experience could still be on the table.  I also play guitar and you know I produce a bit of EDM.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also did you know that Halsey went to RISD for one year before transferring out.  Guess she got bored of playing with

            I‚Äôm generally athletic and can literally teach you any sport.  My favorite store growing up back in the day were sporting
            goods stores.  I loved the smell of sports equipment, and have tons of sports knowledge I can impart on to you.  My main
            specialties would be tennis, basketball, ping pong, rock climbing, baseball, football, long boarding.  I even dabbled in roller hockey
            a bit as a kid.  I can also talk your ear off about pro tennis including the US Open in flushing, and to a lesser degree
            pro basketball.  I can also make ping pong fun for newbies and teach you the ropes (literally) at a rock climbing gym üòù.

            I‚Äôm a good driver.  I grew up in SoCal and lived in LA for 5 years as an adult so I know a thing or two about driving through
            traffic, parallel parking, parking on hills.  We also road trip to Tahoe (snowboarding) and Vegas (party) a lot in California
            and I‚Äôm pretty competent on long drives.  A nice road trip with the right music and your favorite person üëåüëå.
            And I‚Äôve owned two stick shifts so it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd be open to teaching and sharing üòù.

          Okay!  Enough of this self promotion.  This is so not me, but I'm also sad you'll never get to discover any of this for
          yourself.  So I just wanted you to know.

          Well B, you've touched me in ways no one else ever could, and hurt me in ways that I've never felt before.
          Despite all that, I'm still crazy about you.  You taught me what it meant to be truly happy with someone, that
          there was more to it than what I'd experienced so far in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past two years, I've tried things out with a few other people, but no one even comes close to you.  When you said
          that I could do so much better than you, did you mean a girl who's good on paper?  And that's not to say that you aren't, 
          I'm just interpreting it the only way I can imagine you to mean it.  Well, I've tried things out with a few,
          MBA grads, doctors, girls who are on the fast track to the C-suite, girls who parents have trusts and huge real estate portfolios
          for them to inherit and who live in fancy condos in the city.  It just confirmed what I've always known, none of that stuff
          matters to me at all.  They don't stack up to you.  I've literally thought about
          you while I'm out with them and then I'm suddenly sad, sad at what I missed out on.  Sad that we never gave it a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I'm not that good in the beginning.  I actually don't have very much experience going after the girl
          I'm into.  I think I just get too nervous or overthink and always mess things up.  But if we're talking about a lifetime, I'd like to think that the begining is such a small piece
          of the pie.  Fancy dinners, and impressing girls with your ability to ice skate, these things just seem
          so superficial compared to a lifetime of, working hard to get to know people your partner cares about, sitting
          with her when she's sick and bringing her gatorade and chicken soup, learning about your partner's interests and
          being opened minded to trying things out that you think you'll hate, holding her hair back and rubbing her back
          while she's vomitting in the Google bathroom after a crazy night üòÇ, going after shared goals together like
          creating a business together or youtube channel or looking for the best place to buy a forever home and planning
          for a family.  Like you said, guys stop trying after the beginning, so what's left after that.  Who someone really
          is deep down.  I'd like to think that's where I shine, why people like to keep me in their life long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dad's not super romantic either and sometimes he's downright cranky and hard to be around.  I asked my mom
          once, why she married him.  Despite all that crankiness, he's responsible and honest and takes care of the family.
          He's a man in ways that aren't that flashy and my mom understands and appreciates that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess this thinking is very bay area.  It's more practical, it's not flashy, and it takes a lot longer to
          appreciate someone for these things.  But these are the things I value and care about and all the girls who've at one point loved
          me, I can only imagine that's what they saw in me, cause I clearly have no game.  I saw these things in you too, I know you value them.  I guess
          I just didn't realize you cared so much about the beginning and the romance too.  Especially with all your relationship
          experience, I know you know what the important things really are.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way I see it, living well is an art.  And with art there is no destination, you just constantly work hard to
          be better than you were yesterday and see how far you get.  So if there's one thing I'll take away from never getting
          a shot with the most amazing girl that's ever walked into my life, it's the awareness of this side of things, of romance and 
          the chase in the beginning stages of a relationship.  You've given
          me a new color to paint with.  I'm not very good at it yet, but at least I know it exists now.  And maybe just maybe
          when the second most amazing girl pops into my life, the portrait of my life will be refined enough for her to love me back.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when that day comes, I wonder if I'll half hope to never see you again.  Because you'll be the only person who knows
          that I settled for number two.  Or will that day never come because no one will ever compare to the mark
          you've left on my heart.  Le sigh üòî.  If you never love me back, I really hope this letter helps me get over you.  Maybe I just need
          a more substantial reason than the timing was bad or we got intimate too fast.  The look in your eyes that
          Wednesday night, I know you felt something too.  Anyways, you know you'll always have a place in my heart and can always
          reach out to me for anything.  And I really hope I mean more to you than the 14th guy to break your heart or maybe just
          disappoint you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, I hope
          you have an amazing life and find what you're looking for.  The man you choose is a truly lucky person and I hope
          he understands that and appreciates all that you have to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for everything.  Real talk, you were the most life changing thing that's ever happened to me.  Stay amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yours truly, <br/>
